<td style="vertical-align: top; text-align: center;"> NextLabs’ DAE for SAP 2021  

On July 19th, 2021, NextLabs announced the release of DAE for SAP 2021. This is an enhancement to the industry leading DAE for SAP, which uses attribute-based and centralized policies to improve security and compliance posture for SAP. 

NextLabs’ DAE for SAP 2021 is available as a SaaS product, allowing users to seamlessly use this product on AWS. DAE for SAP 2021 not only helps SAP customers using AWS overcome common challenges such as balancing the increasing need to share with employees and partners while securing business-critical data, but also helps them ensure regulatory compliance and reduces their security management cost.  

DAE for SAP provides dynamic data-level security controls and fine-grained data access governance to SAP applications. The product can be implemented rapidly with zero code and zero role impact, to enforce real time data-level security controls using NextLabs’ Dynamic Authorization and attribute-based (ABAC) policy engine. DAE for SAP provides dynamic field-level data masking and data segregation, while monitoring data access from within the data access layer. This enables the enforcement to work independent of UI, API, microservice, batch job, ad-hoc query, report, Transaction, and Fiori app with seamless support for debug and table content access, while allowing a new policy to be implemented and tested in under an hour. 

Key enhancements of DAE for SAP 2021 include dynamic data filtering, geolocation support, and extensible support for SAP applications. Additionally, DAE for SAP has improved user messaging, extended enforcement on Data Manipulation Language (DML), simplified configuration, and improved error handling in this 2021 release. 

 With DAE for SAP, enterprises using AWS can enable employees, external partners, and contractors to securely share information, improving business agility. The patented policy-driven dynamic authorization platform also helps organizations identify and protect data, monitor, and control access to sensitive data, and help prevent regulatory violations in the cloud. Customers using the SaaS version of DAE for SAP benefit from automatic software updates or upgrades and receive quick time to value with less upfront cost. NextLabs professional services team can help deploy and customize customer instances in AWS and other cloud platforms upon request.
